# gusture-controlled-car

This project demonstrates a gesture-controlled robotic car that utilizes an ESP32, an accelerometer (MPu6050), and a wireless transmission system to control movement based on hand gestures. The system interprets tilt-based motion of the accelerometer, translating forward, backward, left, and right gestures into respective commands for the carâ€™s motors via RF or Bluetooth communication. The receiver, mounted on the robot car, interprets these signals and activates the motors accordingly using a motor driver IC (like L293D).

This project combines fundamental concepts of embedded systems, wireless communication, and motion sensing, making it ideal for engineering students and hobbyists exploring human-machine interaction or remote control robotics. The Arduino code in this repository is well-commented, helping users understand how analog accelerometer data is processed and translated into digital movement commands. This project can be further extended by integrating obstacle detection using ultrasonic sensors or adding a smartphone interface via Bluetooth modules like HC-05.
